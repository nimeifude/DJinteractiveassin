							<h3>Winter is coming —— Where do Boston’s homeless go after the COVID-19 pandemic?</h3>
							<div class="spce sm"></div>
							<p>by lingxiao Liu and Jiazhen Zhang, October 24, 2023.
							</p>

							<p>The rehousing efforts for the homeless have stalled as shelters have had to reduce their
								 capacity by half in order to mitigate the spread of the virus as a result of the COVID-19
								  pandemic. Therefore the number of encampments multiplied, especially represented by the 
								  stubborn Mass&Cass, which became the first part of Boston to be dealt with.</p>

							<p>Homeless people and their situation are often misunderstood and overlooked, and we can start 
								by looking at the factors that contribute to being homeless, learning about the distribution 
								of homeless shelters in Boston, and helping Boston's homeless population to weather the storm 
								by learning about the organizations, agencies, and programs that serve homeless people who wish 
								to seek shelter and improve their situation.
							</p>

							<p>The pandemic magnified the important tie between housing and health care, and the Boston Public 
								Health Commission responded quickly to try to achieve success through innovative practices in
								 collaboration, outreach, shelter, supportive services, and housing.

						<h3>7 Criteria for Determining Risk of Homelessness</h3>
						<div class="spce"></div>
						<div class="spce"></div>
						<p class="large">Amelia Najjar, a student at Tufts University, investigated and summarized 
							the distribution of homeless shelters in Boston and the resources available to them. 
							Homeless people were categorized and researched separately based on seven characteristics,
							 which were combined with data on walking distances between shelters and the nearest 
							 services in different areas, resulting in seven maps of areas at risk of homelessness.</br>
							 <div class="spce"></div>
							 <p class="large">Using census tracts, a map was created for each characteristic. For a given characteristic, 
								each tract was ranked from one to four, with one being the lowest concentration and four 
								being the highest concentration of the variable. For each tract She summed the rankings 
								for all seven variables to yield an overall ranking. The tracts with the highest ranking 
								were the most at-risk of being homeless.</p>

						<h2>Homeless, unhoused, or housing-deprived?</h2>
						<div class="spce"></div>
						<p class="large">When first used in the United States in the 1870s, 
							the term “homelessness” was meant to describe itinerant “tramps” traversing 
							the country in search of work. Today, homelessness is primarily a condition
							 of a lack of stable, safe, and functional housing. While crime, drugs, and 
							 laziness account for only a small proportion of the cases in which people 
							 lose their homes, the causes of homelessness for the majority of people are 
							 complex, painful, and difficult to change. They are not incorrigible, but their 
							 social situation makes it much more difficult for them to leave their current
							  state. “What usually happens is that, over time, a term that may have been 
							  neutral at some point becomes pejorative,” said Robin Queen, a linguistics 
							  professor at the University of Michigan. We have to recognize that the 
							  neutral word "homeless" has now acquired discriminatory, ugly hidden meanings
							   that are unfair to those struggling to change their circumstances.</br>
							   <div class="spce"></div>
							   <p class="large">Until we know a person's story, it might be more prudent to 
								use more neutral words, such as unhoused or housing-deprived.</p></br>

					<p class="large">But at the end of the day, the root cause of homelessness is
						housing, and Boston, which has the smallest percentage of homelessness of 
						any major city, has done a lot of hard work in the post-COVID-19 era and 
						with all the nonprofits working to address the situation of homeless people, and has seen promising results.</br>

							<p class="large">Generalizations about homeless people may, in turn, lead to an apathetic
								 response from many social groups to the need for volunteering to help the homeless. 
								In fact, the homeless include many families, as well as single mothers, pregnant females,
									teenagers and children lacking guardians, people with disabilities, veterans, and other
									 unique individuals.From this perspective, perhaps each of us is closely related to the
										homeless and their plight. No man is an island, and the alleviation or even resolution
										 of homelessness and housing issues will inevitably lead to a better and more peaceful
										  future for Boston, and for each resident living in this city.
